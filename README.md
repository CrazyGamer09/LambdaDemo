# Welcome to your CDK JavaScript project / Demo lambda project

Some demo code for lambda function, describing lambda version, attaching alias name and creating a sample layer.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

## Useful commands

* `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
